     * This is useful when the Express "trust proxy" setting is properly setup to simplify development vs production configuration.
     *
     * If you have your node.js behind a proxy and are using `secure: true`, you need to set "trust proxy" in express. Please see the [README](https://github.com/expressjs/session) for details.

     * Please see the [README](https://github.com/expressjs/session) for an example of using secure cookies in production, but allowing for testing in development based on NODE_ENV.
